		my_dungeon.add_room(:jail, "Jail", "a room where rusting spikes line the walls and ceiling\nof this chamber. The dusty floor shows no sign that the walls move\nover it, but you can see the skeleton of some humanoid impaled on\nsome wall spikes nearby.", {:south => :study, :west => :library, :north => :pettingzoo}, :doors)
		my_dungeon.add_room(:lavatory, "Lavatory", "a room that is lined with benchlike seats on all the walls.\nThe seats all have holes in their top, like a privy. Facing stones\non the front of the benches prevent you from seeing how deep the holes\ngo. It looks like a communal bathroom.", {:west => :study, :east => :treasureroom, :south => :chapel}, :average)
		my_dungeon.add_room(:courthall, "Courthall", "a broad, pillared hall. The columns of stone are carved\nas tree trunks and seem placed at random like trees in a forest.\nStone root systems crawl out into the floor and marble branches expand\nacross the ceiling. You even note a few carvings of small\nbirds and squirrels.", {:east => :chapel, :west => :fountain}, :continents)
		my_dungeon.add_room(:fountain, "Fountain Room", "a room where the burble of water reaches your ears\nafter you open the door. You see the source of the noise in the far\nwall: a large fountain artfully carved to look like a seashell with\nthe figure of a seacat spewing clear water into its basin.", {:east => :courthall, :west => :westwing, :north => :guestroom}, :daughters)
		my_dungeon.add_room(:shrine, "Shrine Room", "a room that is a tomb. Stone sarcophagi stand in five rows\nof three, each carved with the visage of a warrior lying in state.\nIn their center, one sarcophagus stands taller than the rest. Held up\nby six squat pillars, its stone bears the carving of a beautiful\nwoman who seems more asleep than dead. The carving of the warriors\nis skillful but seems perfunctory compared to the love a sculptor\nmust have lavished upon the lifelike carving of the woman.", {:east => :library, :south => :masterbedroom, :west => :antechamber}, :noon)
		my_dungeon.add_room(:eastwing, "East Wing", "a room where a large forge squats against the far wall\nof this room, and coals glow dimly inside. Before the forge stands a\nwide block of iron with a heavy-looking hammer lying atop it, no doubt\nfor use in pounding out shapes in hot metal. Other forge tools hang in\nracks nearby, and a barrel of water and bellows rest on the floor nearby", {:west => :chapel, :north => :treasureroom}, :months)
		my_dungeon.add_room(:westwing, "West Wing", "a room that is lit dimly by guttering candles that squat\nin small hills of melted wax. The smell of their smoke hits your nose\nalong with an odor that is reminiscent of the sea. Someone has taken\na large amount of salt and drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor\nwith the candles situated equidistantly around it. Atop the salt,\nsomeone traced the symbol with a black powder that glints a dull\nsilver in the candlelight.", {:east => :fountain, :north => :masterbedroom}, :hole)
		my_dungeon.add_room(:trophyroom, "Trohpy Room", "a room with a dozen statues stand or kneel in this room,\nand each one lacks a head and stands in a posture of action or defense.\nAll are garbed for battle. It's difficult to tell for sure without\ntheir heads, but two appear to be dwarves, one might be an elf, six\nappear human, and the rest look like they might be orcs.", {:east => :armory, :north => :icehouse}, :brick)

		my_dungeon.add_room(:pettingzoo, "Petting Zoo", "a room with a horrendous, overwhelming stench. Small cages\ncontaining small animals and large insects line the walls. Some of the\ncreatures look sickly and alive but most are clearly dead. Their\nrotting corpses and the unclean cages no doubt result in the zoo's\nfoul odor. A cat mews weakly from its cage, but the other creatures\njust silently shrink back into their filthy prisons.", {:east => :icehouse, :south => :jail}, :race, "key")
		my_dungeon.add_room(:chapel, "Chapel", "a room with hundreds of dusty tapestries. All show signs of\nwear: moth holes, scorch marks, dark stains, and the damage of years\nof neglect. They hang on all the walls and hang from the ceiling to\nbrush against the floor, blocking your view of the rest of the room.", {:north => :lavatory, :east => :eastwing, :west => :courthall}, :sheep)
		my_dungeon.add_room(:icehouse, "Ice House", "a room where, as the door opens, it scrapes up frost from a\nfloor covered in ice. The room before you looks like an ice cave.\nA tunnel wends its way through solid ice, and huge icicles and pillars\nof frozen water block your vision of its farthest reaches.", {:south => :trophyroom, :west => :pettingzoo}, :three)
		my_dungeon.add_room(:library, "Library", "a room where a flurry of bats suddenly flaps through the\ndoorway, their screeching barely audible as they careen past your head.\nThey flap past you into the rooms and halls beyond. The room from\nwhich they came seems barren at first glance. But as you look further,\nyou can start making out lots of bookcases lining all the walls.\nThey are now completely covered in dust and cobwebs, and the floor\nis covered in bat dung.", {:east => :jail, :west => :shrine}, :dictionary)
		my_dungeon.add_room(:armory, "Armory", "a chamber which once served as an armory. Armor and weapon\nracks line the walls and rusty and broken weapons litter the floor.\nIt hasn't been used in a long time, and all the useful weapons have\nbeen taken but for a single sword. Unlike the other weapons in the\nroom, this one gleams untarnished in the light.", {:west => :trophyroom, :south => :treasureroom}, :noon2)
		my_dungeon.add_room(:antechamber, "Antechamber", "a room that is a small antechamber before two titanic bronze\ndoors. Each stands 20 feet tall and is about 7 feet wide. The double\ndoors are peaked at their centers, but unlike many sets of double\ndoors, their division isn't in the center. Instead, the crack between\nthe doors resembles a crooked bolt of lightning, which a figure in a\ncloud carved in the stone above the door appears to be hurling. The\nlightning bolt strikes down roughly 2 feet to the right of center.\nThe figure in the clouds is deliberately indistinct, but it appears\nmale, having a beard and male proportions. The stroke of bronze\nelectricity hits a tower that seems small compared to the figure.\nThis tower cracks down the center, continuing the gap between the\ndoors until it reaches the ground. To either side of the tower lie\npastoral scenes of hillsides dotted with sheep. There doesn't appear\nto be a lock or handles.", {:south => :exit, :east => :shrine}, :word)

		my_dungeon.add_room(:masterbedroom, "Master Bedroom", "a room unlike the flagstone common throughout the castle,\nthis room is walled and floored with black marble veined with white.\nThe ceiling is similarly marbled, but the thick pillars that hold it\nup are white. A brown stain drips down one side of a nearby pillar.\nThere is an old canopy bed in the corner, but the fabric is torn and\njust hanging down and there is a corpse laying on the bed.", {:south => :westwing, :east => :guestroom, :north => :shrine}, :socks)
		my_dungeon.add_room(:study, "Study", "a tiny room that holds a curious array of machinery. Winches\nand levers project from every wall, and chains with handles dangle\nfrom the ceiling. On a nearby wall, you note a pictogram of what\nlooks like a scythe on a chain.", {:west => :guestroom, :east => :lavatory, :north => :jail}, :shape)
		my_dungeon.add_room(:guestroom, "Guest Room", "a room in which light can't penetrate the gloom. An unnatural\nshade fills it, and the room's farthest reaches are barely visible.\nNear the room's center, you can just barely perceive a lump about the\nsize of a human lying on the floor. (It might be a dead body, a pile\nof rags, or a sleeping monster that can take advantage of the room's\ndarkness.)", {:west => :masterbedroom, :south => :fountain, :east => :study}, :fire)
